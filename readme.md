# Devlite

**Devlite** is a simple, ready-to-go development environment. Just set **a couple of** variables, open VS Code (`code .`), and start codingâ€”**no crazy-complicated setup is required**.

## Features
- **Minimal Configuration:** Only *a couple of* required settings.
- **Ubuntu-based DevContainer:** Optimized for development.
- **Preconfigured Stack:** PHP, Node.js, MariaDB, Redis.
- **VS Code Integration:** Open the project folder using **code .** and let DevContainers handle the rest.

## Quick Setup


1. Open a terminal and go to the folder where you cloned *devlite*. **cd /you-project-folder**
2. Load Visual Studio Code by typing: ```code .```

4. When *vscode* loads, it will see the devcontainer configuration and ask you if you want to open it. Just close this dialog for now.

5. Open the **.env.template** file and change the WORKSPACE_FOLDER name to match the name of your project folder into which you you cloned devlite.

6. Open the **.devcontainer/devcontainer.json** file and update its value to match the **WORKSPACE_FOLDER** variable set in Step 4.

At this point, there is an assumption that you know what to do with a running devcontainer. If you need further assistance, there is a plethora of documentation online about devcontainers. There is also a [Devlite Wiki](https://github.com/moztopia/devlite/wiki) where I will slowly add some more documentation and requested topics.

## Tech Stack
- **OS:** Ubuntu (containerized)
- **Languages:** PHP, Node.js
- **Databases:** MariaDB, Redis
- **IDE Support:** XDebug, VS Code (via DevContainer)

## Build and Load Expectations

The initial build process **can take a significant amount of time** if there are no cached images or common layers available. The build time depends on your hardware:
- **First-time build (no cache):** ~250 seconds
- **Rebuilding after deleting containers:** ~60 seconds
- **Starting containers of an existing environment:** ~6 seconds

Once the initial build is complete, subsequent starts are much faster, ensuring a **lightweight and efficient development workflow**.
